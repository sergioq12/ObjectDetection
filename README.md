# ObjectDetection
 This is an Object Detection Project using TensorFlow to detect the presence of Golf Flags in Images and Real time video.

 This Object Detection model was taught by Nicholas Renotte in his youtube channel through this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U&t=7340s

 I learned from it and developed my own OD Model to detect Golf Flags.
